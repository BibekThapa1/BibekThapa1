# Hi there, I'm Bibek Thapa! 👋

> "Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and learned as a precise science. We can discover principles and techniques useful throughout the process of software creation, but there is no exact path from a real-world need to working code."

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Backend Development** 🔧. I believe in designing systems that are **flexible, maintainable, and scalable**, where every component is **highly cohesive and loosely coupled**. Problem decomposition and thoughtful design are at the heart of everything I build.

I love creating **web and mobile applications** that solve real-world problems while keeping maintainability and adaptability in mind.
