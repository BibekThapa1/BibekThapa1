# Hi there, I'm Bibek Thapa! 👋

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Backend Development** 🔧. I believe in designing systems that are **flexible, maintainable, and scalable**, where every component is **highly cohesive and loosely coupled**. Problem decomposition and thoughtful design are at the heart of everything I build.

I love creating **web and mobile applications** that solve real-world problems while keeping maintainability and adaptability in mind.
